All plots of the bachelor thesis can be found in the plots folder.
The classifier, the shap values and the test data + labels are saved as .lib or .json. So the paper_plots file can be run without computing the model first.
To understand the workflow of this project, the predict_workflow and clustering_workflow are provided as Python notebooks. There are a few additional plots. When run, they will also update the previously mentioned files.
